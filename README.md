<p> ✅ Create route GET * return the index.html (HTML Routes)</p>
<p> ⬜ Create route GET /api/notes that reads the db.json file and return all saved notes as JSON </p>
<p> ⬜ Create route POST /api/notes that adds to the db.json file and then returns the new note to frontend. Also gives each note a unique ID.  </p>

## Notes 
I had to comment out the apiRoute info on the server document, every time I ran the server in the termenal I would get an error that wouls say 'module not found'.
